# Bincoulars
Repository for all supplemental parts made for my Clone Trooper Build
### Please Read Before Downloading 3D File
NOTE: These files were built by me for my personal use.  I'm happy to share them with anyone who wants them but they 'are as they are'.  They may work for your particular, they may not.  I tend to print things "quick and dirty" and fix them later.  Good luck, message me with any questions. 

These files do take time and work, if you'd like to contribute you can click the link below and feed my caffine addiction so I can get back to making more files to share.
