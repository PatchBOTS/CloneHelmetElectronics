# Clone Trooper Build - The Radio Pack
This Repository is for the 3D files needed to print the Radio Pack found in this video: https://youtu.be/kG_VW7UEpcM 

### Please Read Before Downloading 3D Files

These files were built by me for my personal use.  I'm happy to share them with anyone who wants them but they 'are as they are'.  They may work for your particular build, they may not.  I tend to print things "quick and dirty" and fix them later.  Good luck, message me with any questions. 

These files do take time and work, if you'd like to contribute you can click the link below and feed my caffine addiction so I can get back to making more files to share.

One thing not covered in the video is the 3D part called Radio Top Knob Spacer.STL    When I inserted the rotarty endocder through the printed part for the TOP KNOB. The knob sat too high.  So instead I installed the knob into this spacer and glued it in from below, exposing the bare minimum of the rotary endcoder needed to mount the knob.
